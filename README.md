1. Voter Registration

An adult citizen of India will have to make a digital signature before voting. The digital signature will have lifetime validity. The user will need to visit the government office, get his/her credentials verified and receive the second half of the digital signature generated by government servers. Once the second half is added, the complete SHA256 hash is stored in a blockchain along with the user's data. After the user gets it made, he or she can use it to vote remotely, too. The bigger blockchain containing digital signature hashes will not be stored on every node. It will be on government servers. 

2. Vote Storage

There will be state-wise blockchains, with each blockchain hosted on every server in a P2P format.









The given flowchart provides an outline of our idea. Please start reading from "The USER" in either direction.
